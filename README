This code runs successfuly. The 10 differnt color bands and approtiate pages are linked together. 
The Camera Gadget was used successfully. There is a "show camera" button on the camera tab but when clicked nothing happens. 
I think this might be beacuse the code would need to be linked to the camera for the specific device. Overall well done.

Great work! Same issue with the "Show Camera" button. I noticed you chose the camera application which was 
nice to see in action because I chose a different application. Overall the code is concise and successfull!
